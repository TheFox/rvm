# RVM

Educational Virtual Machine written in Rust.

## Project Outlines

The project outlines as described in my blog post about [Open Source Software Collaboration](https://blog.fox21.at/2019/02/21/open-source-software-collaboration.html).

- The main purpose of this software is to teach Virtual Machines. Not only I get a better understanding of how VMs work, but also people can look at the code and play around. This is also the reason why this software is [public domain](LICENSE), because its main existence is for education.
- RVM will be more like the [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine), meaning an application virtualization software. Not to be confused with [an emulation of a computer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).
- This list is open. Feel free to request features.

## Planned features

- Compiler
- [Runtime environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system)
- Executeable with self-included Runtime environment
